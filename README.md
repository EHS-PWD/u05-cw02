### U05-CW02 - Text Formatting Intermediate

**Objective:**  
Students will enhance the "Russian Tortoises" website by learning to use additional CSS text properties: `text-align`, `text-decoration`, `line-height`, `text-indent`, and `font-variant`. They will apply these properties while maintaining clear, organized comments in their CSS file.

---

1. **Open Your Project**  
   - Open the "Russian Tortoises" website files (`index.html`, `care.html`, and `styles.css`) in your text editor.
   - Continue organizing your CSS file with comments for each section. For this assignment, you will add new styles to existing sections and add comments for the changes.

2. **Align Text in the Header**  
   - Find the `/* Header Styles */` comment. 
   - Center-align the text in the `<header>` rule set.

3. **Apply Line Height to Paragraphs**  
   - Find the `/* Paragraph Styles */` comment.  
   - Increase readability of the `<p>` rule set by adding a line height of 1.6.

4. **Indent the First Line of Paragraphs**  
   - Under the same `<p>` rule set, indent the first line of all paragraphs using `text-indent: 20px;`.

5. **Decorate Links with Underlines**  
   - Find the `/* Link Styles */` comment.  
   - The `<a>` rule set should have a text decoration that will make all links have an underline.  
   - Retain the hover effect from the previous assignment.

6. **Style the Aside Section with Small Caps**  
   - Find the `/* Aside Styles */` comment.  
   - For text inside the `<aside>` rule set, use the font varient property to have a value of small-caps to enhance its appearance.

7. **Test Your Changes**

   - Open both `index.html` and `care.html` in Google Chrome to verify the updated text formatting and organization.
   - Ensure all sections are styled consistently.
   - Use the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to ensure your CSS is valid.

8. **Submit Your Work**
   - Once you've confirmed that styling looks good, submit the following:
   - Submit your `styles.css` file inside of Google Classroom.
